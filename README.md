# Computed-Tomography-Reconstruction
The following repo contains implementations of classical line integral methods for reconstructing computed tomography slices from photon emission/detection properties

# Requirements (Installing dependancies)
For installing the required dependancies, first start by cloning the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/vbhavank/Computed-Tomography-Reconstruction.git
```

Installing the required dependancies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To visualize random slices of the sample data, run:
```
python data_visualize.py
```
